;;; iscroll.el --- Smooth scrolling over images      -*- lexical-binding: t; -*-

;; Author: Yuan Fu <casouri@gmail.com>

;;; This file is NOT part of GNU Emacs

;;; Commentary:
;;
;; Gone are the days when images jumps in and out of the window when
;; scrolling! This package makes scrolling over images as if the image
;; is made of many lines, instead of a single line. (Indeed, sliced
;; image with default scrolling has the similar behavior as what this
;; package provides.)
;;
;; To use this package:
;;
;;     M-x iscroll-mode RET
;;
;; This mode remaps mouse scrolling functions. If you use other
;; commands, you need to adapt them accordingly. See
;; `iscroll-mode-map' and `iscroll-mode' for some
;; inspiration.
;;
;; Commands provided:
;;
;; - iscroll-up
;; - iscroll-down
;; - iscroll-next-line
;; - iscroll-previous-line
;;
;; Used to be image-scroll.el, but image-scroll-up/down collide with
;; image.el
;;
;; Limitations:
;;
;; - Currently we only look for images at the beginning of a line.
;; - Doesn't work with `scroll-preserve-screen-position'. But you can
;;   use the PRESERVE-SCREEN-POS flag.
;; - Scrolling over images in other window sometimes doesn’t work.
;; - If you scroll over an image partially and move point to another
;;   window, sometimes the image jumps back to display completely.
;; - If there is only one line after an image, you can’t scroll that
;;   image down. Why? I have no idea.


;;; Developer
;;
;; About the implementation:
;;
;; Scrolling n lines once is much more efficient than scrolling 1 line
;; n times (see benchmarks at the end of the file). So we prefer
;; scrolling in batch. For that reason, we try to do a ”dry run”
;; before actually scrolling. ”Dry run” means moving point when
;; scrolling over logical lines, and simply incrementing vscroll
;; amount when scrolling over images. When we finished the dry-run, we
;; apply the logical scrolls with `set-window-start` and vscroll
;; amount with `set-window-vscroll`.
;;
;; In practice this is indeed much more efficient when ARG (number of
;; lines to scroll) is larger than 1. That’s important for me because
;; I usually scroll 3 lines at once.

;;; Code:

;; The actual treatment code
(defun mu4e~patch-state-machine ()
  "Colorize a part of the mu4e-view buffer.

Implement the state machine which colorizes a part of an article
if it looks patch-like.

The state machine works like this:

  0a. The machinery starts at the first line of the article's
      body. Not the header lines. We don't care about header
      lines at all.

  0b. The whole thing works line by line. It doesn't do any
      forward or backward looks.

  1. Initially, we assume, that what we'll see first is part of
     the patch's commit-message. Hence this first initial state
     is \"commit-message\". There are several ways out of this
     state:

       a) a scissors line is found (see 2.)
       b) a pseudo-header line is found (see 3.)
       c) a three-dashes line is found (see 4.)
       d) something that looks like the start of a unified diff is
          found (see 7.)

  2. A scissors line is something that looks like a pair of
     scissors running through a piece of paper. Like this:

      ------ 8< ----- 8< ------

     or this:

      ------------>8-----------

     The function `mu4e~patch-scissors-line-p' decides whether a
     line is a scissors line or not. After a scissors line was
     treated, the machine will switch back to the
     \"commit-mesage\" state.

  3. This is very similar to a scissors line. It'll just return
     to the old state after its being done. The
     `mu4e~patch-pseudo-header-p' function decides if a line is a
     pseudo header. The line will be appropriately colored.

  4. A three-dashes line is a line that looks like this: \"---\".
     It's the definite end of the \"commit-message\" state. The
     three dashes line is coloured and the state switches to
     \"commit-comment\". (See 5.)

  5. Nothing in \"commit-comment\" will appear in the generated
     commit (this is git-am specific semantics, but it's useful,
     so...). It may contain things like random comments or -
     promimently - a diff stat. (See 6.)

  6. A diff stat provides statistics about how much changed in a
     given commit by files and by whole commit (in a summary
     line). Two functions `mu4e~patch-diff-stat-line-p' and
     `mu4e~patch-diff-stat-summary-p' decide if a line belongs to
     a diff stat. It's coloured appropriately and the state
     switches back to \"commit-comment\".

  7. There is a function `mu4e~patch-atp-looks-like-diff' which
     will cause the state to switch to \"unified-diff\" state
     from either \"commit-message\" or \"commit-comment\". In
     this mode there can be a set of lines types:

       a) diff-header lines (`mu4e~patch-diff-header-p')
       b) index lines (`mu4e~patch-index-line-p')
       c) hunk lines (`mu4e~patch-hunk-line-p')
       d) equals line (\"^==*$\")
       e) context lines (\"^ \")
       f) add lines (\"^\\+\")
       g) remove lines (\"^-\")
       h) empty lines (\"^$\")

     This state runs until the end of the part."

(defun mu4e-patch-highlight ()
  "Highlight mail parts, that look like patches.

Well, usually they *are* patches - or possibly, when you take
git's format-patch output, entire commit exports - including
comments). This treatment assumes the use of unified diffs. Here
is how it works:

The most fancy type of patch mails look like this:

  From: ...
  Subject: ...
  Other-Headers: ...

  Body text, which can be reflecting the commit message but may
  optionally be followed by a so called scissors line, which
  looks like this (in case of a scissors line, the text above is
  not part of the commit message):

  -------8<----------

  If there really was a scissors line, then it's usually
  followed by repeated mail-headers. Which do not *have* to
  be the same as the one from the sender.

  From: ...
  Subject: ...

  More text. Usually part of the commit message. Likely
  multiline.  What follows may be an optional diffstat. If
  there is one, it's usually preceded by a line that contains
  only three dashes and nothing more. Before the diffstat,
  however, there may be a set of pseudo headers again, like
  these:

  Acked-by: Mike Dev <md@other.tld>
  Signed-off-by: Joe D. User <jdu@example.com>

  ---
  ChangeLog                    |    5 ++++-
  1 file changed, 4 insertions(+), 1 deletions(-)

  Now, there is again room for optional text, which is not
  part of the actual commit message. May be multiline. Actually,
  anything between the three-dashes line and the diff content
  is ignored as far as the commit message goes.

  Now for the actual diff part.  I want this to work for as
  many unified diff formats as possible.  What comes to mind
  is the format used by git and the format used by cvs and
  quilt.

  CVS style looks like this:

  Index: foo/bar.c
  ============================================================
  --- boo.orig/foo/bar.c       2010-02-24 ....
  +++ boo/foo/bar.c            2010-02-28 ....
  @@ -1823,7 +1823,7 @@
  <hunk>

  There may be multiple hunks. Each file gets an \"Index:\" and
  equals line.  Now the git format looks like this:

  diff --git a/ChangeLog b/ChangeLog
  index 6ffbc8c..36e5c17 100644
  --- a/ChangeLog
  +++ b/ChangeLog
